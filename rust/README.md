# webKNOSSOS Wrapper core library
This directory contains the Rust library for the webKNOSSOS wrapper
format. This is the core library used as basis for C, MATLAB, and Python libraries.

## How to build the library
To build this Rust package, just run
```bash
$ cargo build
```

This requires the [Rust compiler and build tools](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html)
to be installed on your machine. If you're using Linux, then you will
furthermore need the development version of `liblz4` (`lz4` on Arch
Linux, `liblz4-dev` on Debian and Ubuntu).
