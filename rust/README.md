# webKNOSSOS Wrapper core library
This directory contains the Rust library for the webKNOSSOS wrapper
format. This is the core library used as basis for C, MATLAB, and Python libraries.

## How to build the library
To build this Rust package, just run
```bash
$ cargo build
```

This requires the [Rust compiler and build tools](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html)
as well as a C compiler to be installed on your machine.
